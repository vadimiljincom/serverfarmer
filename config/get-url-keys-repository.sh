# Complete URL of your fork of github.com/serverfarmer/sf-keys repository.
#
# For standard Server Farmer deployments, you need to fork 2 repositories:
# - Server Farmer core (https://github.com/serverfarmer/serverfarmer)
# - sf-keys (https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-keys)
#
# In certain high-security scenarios, you only need to fork sf-keys, while
# Server Farmer core can be deployed eg. by custom script downloading TGZ
# archive prepared for each server (or server group, security domain etc.).
